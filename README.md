# **Iberico Alex Photography - Portfolio Project 1**

Iberico Alex Photography is a website that represents my own work as a freelance fashion photographer. It serves as a platform for showcasing my portfolio and provides clients with a convenient way to connect with me. With the aim of creating a useful online presence, I have included various features such as a collection of my best photographs, a selection of produced videos, a brief section about myself, and a contact form for clients to inquire about my services.

Live deployment link can be found [here](https://ibericoalex.github.io/iberico-alex-photography/).

As a **user**, I want **to be able to learn more about the photographer** so that I can **ensure that his background and artistic approach align with my preferences**.


## **Design**
For my project, I used my existing [website](https://www.ibericoalex.com/), built with [wix.com](https://www.wix.com/) website builder, as the foundation. The website showcases a bold, minimal, and clean design that perfectly complements my work and artistic perspective.

All the images and videos presented in the project are exclusively captured and owned by me.

### **Colour**
I have chosen bold colors like red, black, and white to represent my artistic brand. These colors not only enhance the visual appeal but also ensure easy readability for users. To generate the color scheme, I utilized [Coolors.co](https://coolors.co/ff0000-0d0d0d-fafafa-525252).

![Color palette](./assets/documentation/Color-palette.png)
### **Fonts**
I incorporated fonts from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) into my website. For the main headers and logo, I selected the font Roboto, while for the body text, I opted for Nunito. These font choices add a stylish and cohesive touch to the overall design.

### **Wireframes**
Before proceeding with any HTML or CSS coding, I made use of Balsamiq to create wireframes for each of the four pages. This step allowed me to envision and solidify the desired visual structure of the changes I intended to implement from my previous website. By establishing a clear blueprint through wireframes, I could confidently proceed with the development process.

## **Features**
### **Common Features**
As the user navigates through the website, the following elements consistently appear across every page. These elements maintain a cohesive presence throughout the user's browsing experience.
 - **Logo and Navigation Bar** 
    - The logo and navigation bar are prominently displayed on every page of the website. These elements have been carefully designed and optimized to ensure seamless functionality across various screen sizes. The logo serves as a clickable link, directing users back to the homepage/portfolio. Additionally, each link within the navigation menu accurately leads users to the corresponding page, enhancing the overall user experience.

    ![Logo and navigation menu](./assets/documentation/logo-nav.png)

- **Favicon**
    - The favicon displayed on the browser tab encapsulates the branding of Iberico Alex Photography, providing a small yet impactful visual representation of the website's identity.

    ![Favicon](./assets/documentation/Logo-favicon.png)

- **Footer**
    - The footer is consistently visible on every page of the website. It features social media icons that are linked to the corresponding social media platforms, allowing users to easily connect and stay updated with the photographer on these platforms. This enables seamless access to the artist's social media presence and encourages users to stay connected and engaged with their latest updates.

### **Homepage/Portfolio**

The landing page serves as the initial entry point for users when they first visit the website. It prominently showcases the portfolio of the photographer, providing a captivating introduction to their body of work.

The photo gallery draws inspiration from the Code Institute Love Running gallery masonry. When hovering over an image, it reduces its opacity to indicate the selected photo. The ultimate goal is to enable image enlargement upon clicking; however, implementing this functionality would require the use of JavaScript.

Additional noteworthy features include:
- The gallery is fully responsive, adjusting the column count based on the screen size for optimal viewing.
- The navigation bar has a visually appealing effect with a blurred transparent background color.
- On smaller screens, the navigation bar adapts by switching to a centered layout, ensuring both the logo and navigation options are displayed in a user-friendly manner.

![landing-page](./assets/documentation/landing-page.png)

### **Videos**

The video page features a minimalist layout that places central focus on the curated video. Below the main video, additional videos are displayed as thumbnails, providing easy access to more content. Users can find relevant information about the curated video directly below, allowing them to gain insights and context. This streamlined design ensures a straightforward and immersive video viewing experience.

The ultimate goal is to implement a functionality where clicking on the additional video thumbnails would switch the main video and its accompanying description. However, achieving this functionality would require expertise in JavaScript programming.

![videos-page](./assets/documentation/videos-page.png)


### **About**

This page serves as an opportunity for users to delve deeper into the photographer's background and learn more about their artistic journey and expertise. It provides valuable insights and information to help users gain a comprehensive understanding of the photographer's unique perspective and qualifications.
